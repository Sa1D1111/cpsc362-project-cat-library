                    They might have a grumpy looking face, but make no mistake, the Persian cat is as sweet and easy going as it can get. The fancy felines are loving and charming creatures that would get along with the entire family if introduced to them as kittens. But beauty is not always effortless, so Persian cats do require extra attention – find out more about them.

            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>
                Bengals make fabulous pets for experienced cat
                 owners who love an active, curious and dog-like
                  cat - and can keep them entertained with toys,
                   games and plenty of environmental enrichment. No matter 
                   their appeal, if you are after a cat who lies around 
                   looking decorative and stays out of the way, 
                   the Bengal is not for you! They are into everything, 
                   highly amused by simple things such as a dripping tap or flowing water
                    (watch them for knocking your water glass over to see
                     the water spill!), they adore human company and will 
                     play for hours if you are willing - and even if you 
                     aren’t! This is not really a lap cat; they are simply too 
                     busy with stuff and things to want to settle on your lap for long.
                      Although not typically a noisy cat, the Bengal is capable of a loud and strident 
                      cry when things are not going their way or they feel they are lacking attention.

                <p>The Bengal is a relatively modern cat, developed in the 1990s in the USA by crossing the Asian Leopard Cat (Prionailurus bengalensis; a small, strikingly marked wild cat from South West Asia) with the domestic tabby cats and other short haired breeds such as the Abyssinian, Burmese, and Egyptian Mau. The original objective was to produce a pet cat with a sweet nature and resembling miniature leopard, as an alternative to dissuade people from keeping wild cats as pets. Prospective owners of Bengal kittens should note the ‘F number’, which indicates how many generations the kittens are away from the first cross. Be aware that a F1 (first cross between the wild cat and the domestic cat) requires a Dangerous Wild Animal Licence in the UK, however F2 onwards does not.

            <div class="dropdown-content" id="outdoorIndoor-content" style="display: none;">
                <p>The Bengal would love to be an outdoor cat, however given their territorial nature with animals they have not been raised with, their speed, athleticism and taste for mayhem, it isn’t safe to unleash your Bengal on the wider world, or your neighbours. Provide a cat-secure garden or large outdoor cat run full of enrichment and various heights to give your Bengal some outdoor time unless you live deep in the countryside without close neighbours or busy roads.

            <div class="dropdown-content" id="enrichmentNeeds-content" style="display: none;">
                <p>Such active and intelligent cats need to be given plenty to do, or they will amuse themselves in ways you may well not appreciate. A bored Bengal can easily turn to amusing themselves with hunting and predatory play - with other animals and humans often becoming their unwilling entertainment! Provide cat trees to give climbing opportunities, allow access to windows so they can supervise what is going on, feed from food dispensing toys and puzzles, and be ready to play with your Bengal for long hours. They can be social if introduced to other cats and family pets but do beware that two Bengals does not equal less work – if one Bengal can cause a bit of drama, two could cause absolute mayhem with a side order of chaos!

                <p>Every cat is unique and each has their own particular likes, dislikes, and needs when it comes to food. However, cats are carnivores and every cat must obtain 41 different and specific nutrients from their food. The proportion of these nutrients will vary depending on age, lifestyle and overall health, so it's not surprising that a growing, energetic kitten needs a different balance of nutrients in her diet than a less active senior cat. Other considerations to bear in mind are feeding the right quantity of food to maintain 'ideal body condition' in accordance with feeding guidelines and catering to individual preference regarding wet or dry food recipes.

            <div class="dropdown-content" id="grooming-content" style="display: none;">
                <p>Easy to keep clean, the Bengal needs a brush through once a week as an opportunity to check for minor wounds, parasites and the general state of the coat. Doing this regularly is a good chance to bond with your cat and ensure they are fit and healthy. Greasy, scurfy coats can be the first sign your cat is unwell, and has stopped grooming themselves. As with all cats, this breed needs regular vaccinations, parasite control and annual health checks.

                     the Bengal makes an entertaining companion. If you prefer a cat who lies
                      about looking decorative, is quiet and undemanding then the Bengal 
                      is really not the cat for you!  </p>
